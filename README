I submitted Assignment 7 on the master branch. That one is complete without the extra credit. 
I attempted the extra credit, but I can't finish tonight. I've completed some of it and I 
have some concerns. I pushed my extra credit attempt onto the "extra-credit' branch. 

I created an order details object and a purchase order object. Whenever an item is added to 
the cart, it is added to the order details record in ram (instead of the db directly). I intended
on pushing the object to the DB when the user confirms the order, but the confirmation and cart
fragments are populated from the database (which is empty).  

I plan on talking to you about it tomorrow (Thursday) or Friday if I can't find you tomorrow. 
I hope to finish by Friday, but I don't know if I will because I want to work on my final app.
I have to learn the basics of firebase in order to complete the app.
